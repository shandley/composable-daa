# Figure Legends - Spike-in Load Estimation Analysis

## Figure 1: Spike-in Relative Abundance Variation

**File**: `fig1_spikein_variation.png/pdf`

Bar chart showing relative abundance of three spike-in organisms across all 17 samples, sorted by estimated total bacterial load. Despite being added at known amounts:
- **Salinibacter ruber** (red): Added at constant amount - serves as internal standard
- **Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus** (blue): Added at variable amount
- **Rhizobium radiobacter** (green): Added at variable amount

All three spike-ins show ~65% coefficient of variation in relative abundance. This variation arises not from measurement error but from sample-to-sample differences in total bacterial load—high-load samples dilute the spike-ins to lower relative abundances.

## Figure 2: Total Bacterial Load Estimation

**File**: `fig2_load_estimation.png/pdf`

**Panel A**: Estimated relative total bacterial load for each sample, calculated as 1/Salinibacter_relative_abundance (normalized to mean = 1). Load ranges from 0.27x to 2.70x of the average, representing a **9.8-fold variation** across samples.

**Panel B**: Distribution of estimated loads with fold range and log2 range statistics. The 9.8x fold range corresponds to 3.3 log2FC, meaning load variation alone could create apparent effects of up to 3.3 log2FC between samples.

## Figure 3: Spike-in Correlation Matrix

**File**: `fig3_correlation_matrix.png/pdf`

Heatmap showing pairwise Pearson correlations between the three spike-in relative abundances:
- Salinibacter ~ Alicyclobacillus: r = 0.71
- Salinibacter ~ Rhizobium: r = 0.90
- Alicyclobacillus ~ Rhizobium: r = 0.85

High correlations confirm that all spike-ins are affected by the same dilution factor (total bacterial load), validating their use as internal standards. The slightly lower correlation for Alicyclobacillus may reflect its lower abundance and thus higher measurement noise.

## Figure 4: Artifact Potential Demonstration

**File**: `fig4_artifact_potential.png/pdf`

**Panel A**: Scatter plot of Salinibacter relative abundance vs estimated total load, showing the expected inverse relationship. The fitted line (y = k/x) confirms that Salinibacter relative abundance is inversely proportional to total load.

**Panel B**: Conceptual illustration of how load variation creates spurious differences. Two samples with IDENTICAL true abundances of a taxon will show different apparent abundances if they differ in total bacterial load. The 9.8x load range in this dataset could create apparent fold changes of ~3x purely from load differences.

## Figure 5: Effect of Spike-in Normalization

**File**: `fig5_normalization_effect.png/pdf`

**Panel A**: Raw Salinibacter counts across samples (sorted by estimated load). Despite being added at constant amount, counts vary from 515 to 4,824 (CV = 66.3%) due to differences in total load and sequencing depth.

**Panel B**: After spike-in normalization (scaling each sample by median_spike-in / sample_spike-in), all Salinibacter counts are identical (CV = 0.0%). This demonstrates that spike-in normalization successfully removes load-related variation.

## Figure 6: Summary Figure

**File**: `fig6_summary.png/pdf`

Three-panel summary suitable for graphical abstract:

**Panel A**: Bar chart showing 9.8x range in estimated total load across samples.

**Panel B**: Correlation matrix showing high concordance between spike-ins.

**Panel C**: Comparison of typical published effect sizes (small: 2x, moderate: 4x, large: 8x, very large: 16x) against the artifact potential (red shaded region up to 3.3 log2FC). Most "small" and "moderate" effect sizes fall entirely within the artifact zone.

**Key message box**: Summarizes the four main findings and the solution (include spike-in controls).
