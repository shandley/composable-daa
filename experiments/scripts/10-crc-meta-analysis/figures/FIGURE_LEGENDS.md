# Experiment 10: CRC Meta-Analysis - Figure Legends

## Overview

These figures demonstrate cross-study consistency analysis, showing that robust findings should replicate across independent cohorts while study-specific findings require validation.

## Figure 1: Per-Cohort Detection Rates

**File**: `fig1_cohort_comparison.png/pdf`

**Description**: Number of significant and robust taxa detected in each cohort using the Hurdle model.

**Cohort characteristics**:
- Cohort 1: Large effect, low sparsity
- Cohort 2: Large effect, high sparsity
- Cohort 3: Moderate effect, low sparsity
- Cohort 4: Moderate effect, high sparsity

**Key observations**:
- Detection rates vary by cohort characteristics
- More robust findings in large-effect cohorts
- Sparsity reduces detection power

## Figure 2: Cross-Cohort Consistency Distribution

**File**: `fig2_consistency_distribution.png/pdf`

**Description**: Distribution of taxa by how many cohorts show significant detection.

**Categories**:
- 0 cohorts: Not significant anywhere
- 1 cohort: Study-specific (at-risk)
- 2-3 cohorts: Moderate consistency
- 4 cohorts: Most robust

**Key observations**:
- Most taxa significant in only 0-1 cohorts
- Few taxa replicate across all cohorts
- Consistency is a strong filter for robust findings

## Figure 3: Consistency Heatmap

**File**: `fig3_consistency_heatmap.png/pdf`

**Description**: Heatmap showing significance pattern for each taxon across all four cohorts.

**Key observations**:
- Green = significant, gray = not significant
- Few taxa show consistent significance
- Pattern reveals study-specific findings

## Figure 4: Meta-Analysis Best Practices

**File**: `fig4_meta_framework.png/pdf`

**Description**: Framework diagram for conducting rigorous microbiome meta-analyses.

**Three steps**:
1. Consistent methods across all cohorts
2. Per-cohort effect sizes and significance
3. Consistency assessment across cohorts

**Two outcomes**:
- ROBUST: Significant in 3-4 cohorts with large effects
- AT-RISK: Significant in 0-2 cohorts, small effects

## Figure 5: Forest Plot of Effect Sizes

**File**: `fig5_forest_plot.png/pdf`

**Description**: Forest plot showing effect sizes and confidence intervals for example taxa across all cohorts.

**Key observations**:
- Consistent taxa show similar effects across cohorts
- Study-specific taxa show effect in only one cohort
- Artifact threshold (3.3 log2FC) marks robust zone

## Meta-Analysis Recommendations

1. **Use consistent methods**
   - Same pipeline for all cohorts
   - Enables fair comparison

2. **Report per-cohort results**
   - Effect sizes and significance for each
   - Not just pooled results

3. **Assess consistency**
   - How many cohorts agree?
   - Consistent direction of effect?

4. **Classify findings**
   - Robust: 3-4 cohorts, large effects
   - At-risk: 0-2 cohorts or small effects

5. **Key message**
   - Cross-study consistency is the gold standard
   - Study-specific findings require validation
