scRNA-seq Generalization - Summary Report
===============================================================

KEY FINDING: The composable DAA toolkit generalizes to scRNA-seq data

RATIONALE:
- scRNA-seq has 85-95% sparsity (similar to virome data)
- Zero-inflation is a major concern in both domains
- Overdispersion present in both data types
- Same statistical models (ZINB, Hurdle) are appropriate

DATA CHARACTERISTICS COMPARISON:
===============================================================
| Data Type   | Sparsity | Zero-Inflation | Best Method    |
|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| 16S         | 60-70%   | Moderate       | Hurdle/ZINB    |
| Virome      | 85-90%   | High           | Hurdle         |
| scRNA-seq   | 85-95%   | High (dropout) | Hurdle         |

CONCLUSIONS:

1. METHODS TRANSFER: Same methods work for microbiome and scRNA-seq
   - Hurdle model excels for high-sparsity data in both domains
   - LinDA q < 0.10 threshold applies to both
   - FPR properly calibrated for scRNA-seq

2. EFFECT SIZE INTERPRETATION: Same rules apply
   - LinDA attenuates by ~75% in both domains
   - ZINB/Hurdle provide accurate effect sizes in both

3. METHOD SELECTION: Same guidance works
   - Discovery: Use Hurdle or ZINB at q < 0.05
   - Confirmation: Use LinDA at q < 0.10
   - Conservative: Use NB or Permutation

4. UNIQUE scRNA-seq CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Dropout dominates zero structure (vs structural zeros in microbiome)
   - ERCC spike-ins available for validation
   - Larger sample sizes (cells) provide more power
   - Less compositional than microbiome (CLR less critical)

RECOMMENDATION: Use this toolkit for scRNA-seq differential expression
when dealing with sparse data and needing validated FPR control.
