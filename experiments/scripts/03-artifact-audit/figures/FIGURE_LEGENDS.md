# Figure Legends - Compositional Artifact Audit

## Figure 1: Effect Size Distribution with Artifact Zone

**File**: `fig1_effect_size_distribution.png/pdf`

**Panel A**: Histogram showing the distribution of absolute effect sizes (|log2 fold change|) for LinDA (purple) and Hurdle (blue) methods. The red shaded region indicates the "artifact zone" — effect sizes below 3.3 log2FC that could be entirely explained by total load variation (based on Experiment 02 findings).

**Panel B**: Cumulative distribution showing the percentage of taxa with effect sizes below each threshold. The vertical dashed line marks the artifact potential (3.3 log2FC). Approximately 95% of all taxa have effect sizes within the artifact zone, meaning their apparent differential abundance could be a load artifact rather than genuine biology.

## Figure 2: Compositional Closure Comparison

**File**: `fig2_closure_comparison.png/pdf`

**Panel A**: Bar chart comparing the sum of all effect size estimates between LinDA (CLR-based) and Hurdle (count-based) methods. LinDA sum = 0.00 (compositional closure), while Hurdle sum ≠ 0. The red horizontal line indicates zero. This demonstrates that CLR transformation forces mathematical coupling between taxa — if some taxa "increase," others must "decrease" by the same total amount.

**Panel B**: Individual taxon estimates for both methods, sorted by LinDA estimate. The LinDA estimates (purple) are distributed symmetrically around zero, while Hurdle estimates (blue) show a net negative bias. This visualization shows how compositional closure affects the entire distribution of effect sizes.

## Figure 3: Artifact Risk Assessment

**File**: `fig3_artifact_risk.png/pdf`

Stacked bar chart showing the number of significant taxa (q < 0.05) that are "robust" (green, effect size > 3.3 log2FC) versus "at risk" (red, effect size < 3.3 log2FC) for each analysis method. Over 90% of significant findings in both LinDA and Hurdle analyses have effect sizes within the artifact range.

The inset box explains that the 3.3 log2FC threshold comes from Experiment 02's finding of 9.8x load variation across samples.

## Figure 4: Synthesis Diagram

**File**: `fig4_synthesis_diagram.png/pdf`

Conceptual diagram showing how findings from all three experiments connect:

**Experiment 01 (blue box)**: BV Compositional Analysis
- Key finding: Sum of CLR estimates = 0.0000
- Implication: Taxa changes are mathematically coupled

**Experiment 02 (yellow box)**: Spike-in Load Estimation
- Key finding: 9.8x load variation
- Implication: Creates ±3.3 log2FC artifact potential

**Experiment 03 (purple box)**: Artifact Audit
- Key finding: >90% of significant taxa at risk
- Implication: Most findings could be artifacts

**Synthesis (red box)**: Combines all three findings into the conclusion that many published microbiome differential abundance findings may be artifacts of compositional constraints and load variation, not genuine taxon-specific biology.

## Figure 5: Summary Figure

**File**: `fig5_summary.png/pdf`

Three-panel summary suitable for graphical abstract:

**Panel A (Compositional Closure)**: Bar chart showing LinDA sum = 0 vs Hurdle sum ≠ 0.

**Panel B (Load Variation)**: Bar chart showing 9.8x range in estimated bacterial load from spike-in analysis.

**Panel C (Artifact Risk)**: Pie chart showing 90% of significant taxa are at risk for being artifacts.

**Key Message Box**: Summary of three problems (compositional closure, load variation, small effect sizes) and the conclusion that validation with absolute quantification is required.
